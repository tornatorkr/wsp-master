	<h2>Site Intent:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>The website for <a href="http://www.vistacomputerrepair.com/">Vista Computer Repair</a> presents services that they offer prospective business and residential customers.
	   The current design is lacking a coherent and modern UI, as well as direction for end user retention and completion.
	   In addition to structural and navigation changes, the redesign will also encompass responsive and mobile-friendly design characteristics. 
	   To improve retention, completion and return traffic, a user account login / signup CTA will be added to allow clients to perform various tasks 
	   including initiating and tracking of service and sales order requests, as well as receipt of a weekly newsletter via email featuring relevant 
	   current events, tips and sales promotions.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>Based upon geographic location (Orlando, FL), keyword searches for computer repair in <a href="http://www.yelp.com/">Yelp.com</a>
	 and available data from <a href="http://www.alexis.com/">Alexis.com</a>, The following competitors have been identified:</p>
	 <p>PC Shelter <a href="http://www.pcshelter.org/">(pcshelter.org)</a> offers similar services, but with more of a focus on the residential customer.
        It’s advantages include a cleaner UI design, clear navigation links and better site organization.</p>
     <p>Computers R Us <a href="http://www.compuwize.net/">(compuwize.net)</a> also has better UI design, site structure and navigation.  
     It presents the user with a clear CTA that promotes and encourages further exploration of the services offered.  
     One aspect that is lacking is a disconnect between the domain name (compuwize.net) and consistent 
     site branding (Compuwise and Computers R Us).</p>
     <p>Top Computers <a href="http://www.topcomputersit.com/">(topcomputersit.com)</a> utilizes better UI, site structure and navigation.  
     It also employs a more visually engaging design while remaining organized and uncluttered.  
     While the site includes a service request  submission form, the emphasis for CTA is to call 
     by phone or visit a store location.</p>

	<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
</header>

<div>

	<p>Case 1:  A woman in her late 60’s that moved to Orlando several years prior for retirement.  
	She uses her computer for email, photos and some online social networking to keep in contact with her 
	children and grandchildren in upstate New York.  Her laptop has been running really slow and sometimes 
	freezes.  In addition, the power connector is worn and sometimes will not charge up.  
	Her mobility is somewhat impaired and it isn’t easy to travel around town as it used to be.  
	She would like a repair service that makes house calls and has a quick turn around for repair.</p>
	<p>Case 2:  A small business owner with plans to update and expand their restaurant business.  
	The business has outgrown handwritten tickets and manually input spreadsheets.  The restauranteur 
	is looking for a POS system for menu items, order tickets, inventory management, staffing schedule, 
	payroll, P & L and accounting.  The system should be customizable, modular and expandable to accommodate future growth.</p>
